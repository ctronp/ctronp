### Hello Everyone

ðŸ¤” Have you ever wondered why we program in high level? it is because it is fast, but only for programming, once in production it will consume resources and pollute during the processðŸŒ±.

For that and much more I faithfully believe that compiled languages will one day overcome interpreted languages.

Nowadays I find myself developing in Rust, Go, C and C++. While for frontend I usually use SSG if possible, otherwise SSR.

### âš¡ My Ideals:

- Explicit > Implicit (Phrase Stolen from python).
- AOT > JIT > Interpreted
- Open Source > Privative
- TypeScript > JavaScript
- Static Typing > Dynamic Typing
- WASM should be able to access the DOM
- Containers > Virtual Machines
- Linux <3
- btw I used to use arch linux
