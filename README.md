### Hey there, everyone! :wave:

Ever wondered why we use high-level programming languages? :thinking: Beyond rapid development, there's a crucial aspect to consider: security and stability. Compiled languages with static typing often offer enhanced robustness and fewer runtime errors compared to their interpreted and dynamically-typed counterparts. :lock:

That's why I'm a firm believer that compiled languages will eventually become the primary choice for many developers seeking reliability. :muscle:

At the moment, I'm working as a backend developer at [Tuxpan](https://www.tuxpan.com/) :office: and honing my skills in Java and SpringBoot for backend development. :globe_with_meridians:

### My guiding principles are:

- Explicit > Implicit (inspired by Python)
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation > Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation > Interpreted languages 
- Open-source > Proprietary 
- Static typing > Dynamic typing 
- WebAssembly (WASM) should have access to the Document Object Model (DOM) 
- Containers > Virtual Machines 
- Linux <3
