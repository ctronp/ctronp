### Hey there, everyone! :wave:

Have you ever wondered why we use high-level programming languages? :thinking: They may be fast during development, but once in production, they consume resources and pollute the environment. :earth_americas:

That's why I strongly believe that compiled languages will eventually surpass interpreted ones. :muscle:

Currently, I'm working with `C`, `C++`, and `Rust` :computer:, and for frontend and backend, I'm learning `Vue` and `Express`. :globe_with_meridians:

### My principles are:

- Explicit > Implicit (stolen phrase from Python) 
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation > Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation > Interpreted languages 
- Open-source > Proprietary 
- Static typing > Dynamic typing 
- WebAssembly (WASM) should be able to access the Document Object Model (DOM) 
- Containers > Virtual Machines 
- Linux <3 

By the way, I used to be an Arch Linux user... :sunglasses:
