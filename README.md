### Hey there, everyone! 👋

Have you ever stopped to think about why we gravitate toward certain tools or technologies? 🤔 For me, it boils down to one key concept: **balance**. The balance between speed and stability, simplicity and control, scalability and security.

I’m passionate about building reliable and efficient software solutions, whether it’s through robust static typing, scalable cloud architectures, or leveraging open-source technologies. 🔧🔒

Currently, I work as a backend developer at [Flow](https://www.flow.cl/) 🏢, specializing in **PHP**, **Java Spring Boot**, and **AWS**. My day-to-day involves crafting solutions for a fintech platform with scalability, security, and high performance in mind. 🚀🌐

### My guiding principles:

- **Explicit > Implicit**: Clarity drives maintainability. Inspired by Python’s philosophy. 🐍
- **Static Typing > Dynamic Typing**: Catching errors early means fewer headaches later. 🔍
- **Containers > Virtual Machines**: Efficiency and portability in one package. 🐳
- **Linux <3**: The backbone of modern computing. 🐧
- **Open-source > Proprietary**: Collaboration fuels innovation. 🤝
- **Right Tool for the Job**: Pragmatism over dogma. 🛠️
- **WebAssembly (WASM) should dominate the web**: Imagine WASM with full access to the DOM. 🌐

I'm driven by curiosity, guided by principles, and always ready to explore the next challenge. Let’s build something awesome together! 🚀
