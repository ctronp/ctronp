### Hey there, everyone! :wave:

Ever wondered why we use high-level programming languages? :thinking: They may be fast during development, but in production, they consume resources and have an environmental impact. :earth_americas:

That's why I'm a firm believer that compiled languages will eventually surpass interpreted ones. :muscle:

At the moment, I'm working as a full stack developer at [Tuxpan](https://www.tuxpan.com/) :office: and honing my skills in `C`, `C++`, and `Rust` :computer:. For frontend, I'm using `Angular` and for backend, I'm working with `Java`. :globe_with_meridians:

### My guiding principles are:

- Explicit > Implicit (inspired by Python)
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation > Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation > Interpreted languages 
- Open-source > Proprietary 
- Static typing > Dynamic typing 
- WebAssembly (WASM) should have access to the Document Object Model (DOM) 
- Containers > Virtual Machines 
- Linux <3 

Fun fact: I used to be an Arch Linux user... :sunglasses:
