### Hey there, everyone! 👋

Have you ever wondered why we use high-level programming languages? 🤔 Beyond rapid development, there's an important aspect to consider: security and stability. Compiled languages with static typing often provide enhanced robustness and fewer runtime errors compared to their interpreted and dynamically-typed counterparts. 🔒

While I believe compiled languages can offer benefits in terms of reliability, it's all about choosing the right tool for the job and balancing performance with other factors. :muscle:

At the moment, I'm working as a backend developer at [Flow](https://www.flow.cl/) 🏢 and honing my skills in Java Spring Boot, PHP, and AWS for backend development. 🌐

### My guiding principles are:

- Explicit > Implicit (inspired by Python)
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation > Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation > Interpreted languages
- Open-source > Proprietary
- Static typing > Dynamic typing
- WebAssembly (WASM) should have access to the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Containers > Virtual Machines
- Linux <3
